"""Builds the 30+ feature vector consumed by the ensemble ML models.

Feature groups (see README):
  - Benford features (15): chi-square / Z-score / MAD across 5 windows
  - Trade pattern features
  - Volume and timing features
  - Wallet graph features
  - Cross-asset coordination features (6): synchrony, net flow, counterparty overlap, volume
    correlation, pair diversity, Benford MAD std
  - GNN embedding features (GNN_EMBEDDING_DIM, default 32): gnn_0 … gnn_31

Each `compute_*_features` function operates on the trade DataFrame produced
by `ingestion.historical_loader.trades_to_dataframe` (or the streamer,

    ``all_pairs_df`` should contain trades across multiple asset pairs for the
    same wallet. Each trade must relate to ``wallet`` either as ``base_account``
    or as ``counter_account``.

    This function returns six features describing coordination across asset
    pairs (synchrony, net flow closure, counterparty overlap, cross-pair volume
    correlation, pair diversity, and cross-pair Benford MAD consistency).

    Args:
        wallet: Stellar account id to score.
        all_pairs_df: DataFrame containing trades for multiple pairs.
            Expected columns include:

            - ``ledger_close_time``: trade timestamp.
            - ``base_account`` / ``counter_account``: wallet-related accounts.
            - ``amount``: trade amount.
            - ``pair_id``: identifier for the asset pair.

            If ``pair_id`` is not present, the function will attempt to infer it
            from ``base_asset`` and ``counter_asset``.
        pair_benford_sketches: Optional precomputed Benford sketch objects by
            pair and window hour. When provided, cross-pair MAD std is computed
            from these sketches instead of recomputing from trades.

    Returns:
        A dictionary with the following keys:

        - ``cross_pair_trade_synchrony``: fraction of wallet trades where the
          wallet also trades on another pair within the configured synchrony
          window (see ``config.CROSS_PAIR_SYNCHRONY_WINDOW_SECONDS``).
        - ``net_asset_flow_deviation``: maximum absolute net flow (normalized
          by total volume). Values near 0 indicate a closed cycle.
        - ``cross_pair_counterparty_overlap``: Jaccard similarity of
          counterparties between pairs.
        - ``cross_pair_volume_correlation``: Pearson correlation of per-minute
          traded volumes across pairs.
        - ``pair_diversity_score``: normalized Shannon entropy of volume
          distribution across pairs.
        - ``cross_pair_mad_std``: standard deviation / consistency score of
          Benford MAD scores across pairs.

    Raises:
        KeyError: If required columns are missing (e.g., ``ledger_close_time``,
            ``base_account``, ``counter_account``, ``amount``), or if ``pair_id``
            is missing and required asset columns (``base_asset``,
